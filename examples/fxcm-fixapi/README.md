# FIX API

FIX API using FIX Protocol 4.4 designed for real-time, custom institutional interface which push up to 250 price update per second (not available on other APIs). It is our fastest and most popular option. You will get full range of trading order types available at FXCM. An FXCM TSII account with a $5,000 minimum balance is required.
