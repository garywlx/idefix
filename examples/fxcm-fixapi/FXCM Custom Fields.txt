## FXCM Custom fields

From TradingSessionStatus(h):
	FXCMSymPrecision (9001)
	This shows the numerical precision of the security. For example, the USD/JPY security would show a value of 3 for this field because it is quoted to 3 decimal places. AUD/USD would show a value of 5 for this field given that it is quoted to 5 decimal places.

	FXCMSymPointSize (9002)
	The size of the point (pip) of the security. For example, the EUR/USD security would show a value of 0.0001 for this field. This is useful for many purposes, such as calculating the profit or loss of a position in points.

	FXCMSymInterestBuy (9003)
	FXCMSymInterestSell (9004)
	the price is in the currency of your account for the default lot size for your server. If your account is in USD and server default lot size is 10k For example for CAD/JPY 9003(FXCMSymInterestBuy) = 0.64 - you will get $0.64 for 10k 9004(FXCMSymInterestSell) = -1.48 - you will pay $1.48 for 10k The server default lot size you can get from same report from tags: 9017=BASE_UNIT_SIZE 9018=10000

	You can get it also from Trading Station in Simple Dealing Rates under columns Roll S and Roll B

	FXCMProductID (9080)
	FXCMProductID distinguishes each security by its type. There are 5 types of securities: 1-Forex, 2-Index, 3-Commodity, 4-Treasury, and 5-Bullion. As an example, GBP/USD would obviously show a value of 1 for this field, but the CFD Index JPY225 would show a value of 2.

	This field indicates whether the trading desk is opened or closed. When trading is open, this will return “O” for Open. When trading is closed, this will return “C” for Closed.

	The value of this parameter indicates whether or not time values sent from the server will be expressed in UTC. If this is the case, the value of this parameter will be set to “UTC.” If the value of this parameter is not “UTC,” then time values sent from the server will be expressed in the local time zone of the server, which can be checked with the BASE_TIME_ZONE parameter.

	BASE_TIME_ZONE
	This parameter shows the name of the time zone of the server. For example, “America/New_York.”

	COND_DIST
	This parameter shows the minimum recommended distance between the price of new stop or limit orders and the current market price. This is expressed in pips and it is generally defaulted to 0.10.
