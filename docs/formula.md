AskPrice > BidPrice

When you trade forex youâ€™ll see two prices associated with each currency pair. A bid price (the smaller number) and an ask price (the bigger number). When you buy (or go long) on a pair you open an order at the ask price and then close at the bid price. Similarly when you sell (or go short) on a pair you open at the bid price and then close at the ask price.


## Pip Value Calculation

https://www.thebalance.com/calculating-pip-value-in-forex-pairs-1031022

Formular for USD account:
$$
pipV = symbolPointSize * positionQty
$$
Formular for EUR account:
$$
pipV = ( symbolPointSize * positionQty ) \div symbolPrice
$$


- **pointSize** is how many decimal places has the price of a symbol. default is 0.0001.
- **symbolPrice** is the current symbol ask price.
- **positionQty** is the value for the position qty.



### Pip Value Calculation When Trading a USD Account

When the USD is listed second in a pair the pip value is fixed and doesn't change, assuming you have a USD dollar account.

The fixed pip amount is:

- $10 for a standard lot which is 100,000 worth of currency.
- $1 for a mini lot which is 10,000 worth of currency.
- $0.10 for a micro lot is 1,000 worth of currency.

These pip values apply to any pair where the USD is listed second, such as the EUR/USD, [GBP/USD](https://www.thebalance.com/best-time-to-day-trade-the-gbp-usd-forex-pair-1031020), AUD/USD, NZD/USD

If the USD isn't listed second:

- Divide the pip values above by the USD/XXX rate. 

For example, to get the pip value of a standard lot for the USD/CAD, when trading a USD account, divide \$10 by the USD/CAD rate. If the USD/CAD rate is 1.2500 the standard lot pip value in USD is \$8, or \$10 divided by 1.25.



### Pip Value Calculation for a Non-USD Account

Whatever currency the account is, when that currency is listed second in a pair the pip values are fixed. 

For example, if you have a Canadian dollar (CAD) account, any pair that is XXX/CAD, such as the USD/CAD will have a fixed pip value. A standard lot is CAD\$10, a mini lot is CAD\$1, and a micro lot is CAD\$0.10.

To find the value of a pip when the CAD is listed first, divide the fixed pip rate by the exchange rate. For example, to find the value of a mini lot, if the CAD/CHF exchange rate is 0.7820, a pip is worth CAD$1.27.
If the pair includes the [JPY](https://www.thebalance.com/best-time-to-day-trade-the-usd-jpy-forex-pair-1031021), for example the JPY/CAD, then multiply the result by 10. For example, if the CAD/JPY is priced at 89.09, to find out the standard pip value divide CAD\$10 by 89.09, then multiply the result by 10, for a pip value of CAD\$11.23.

Go through this process with any account currency to find pip values for pairs that include that currency.



### Pip Value For Other Currency Pairs

Not all currency pairs include your account currency. You may have a USD account, but want to trade the EUR/GBP. How's how to figure out the pip value for pairs that don't include your account currency. 

The second currency is always fixed if a person had an account in that currency. For example, we know that if a person held a GBP account then the EUR/GBP pip value is GBP10 for a standard lot, as discussed above. The next step is converting GBP10 to our own currency. If our account is USD, divide GBP10 by the USD/GBP rate. If the rate is 0.7600, then the pip value is USD$13.16.

If you can only find a "backward" quote, such as the GBP/USD rate being 1.3152, then divide one by the rate to get 0.7600. That is the USD/GBP rate. You can then do the calculation above. 

If your account currency is euros and you want to know the pip value of the AUD/CAD, remember that for a person with a CAD account a standard lot would be CAD$10 for this pair. Convert that CAD$10 to euros by dividing it by the EUR/CAD rate. If the rate is 1.4813, the standard lot pip value is EUR6.75.

Always consider which currency is providing the pip value: the second currency (YYY). Once you know that, convert the fixed pip value in that currency to your own by dividing it by XXX/YYY, where XXX is your own account currency. 

## Profit & Loss

### Realized Profit

Realized profit is profit that comes from a completed trade; in other words, a trade that has been exited. Realized profit is usually already deposited into the trader's trading account and can be withdrawn from their trading account to a bank account.

Realized profit is included in the account balance in trading account statements and is often shown on trading software as a daily profit that is reset to zero at the beginning of each trading day, to keep track of each day's trading success.

### Unrealized or Paper Profit

Unrealized profit, sometimes called "paper profit" (or "paper loss" if negative), is profit that comes from a currently active trade, such as a trade that has not yet been exited. Unrealized profit is the amount of profit you would take if the trade was exited at that time.

Unrealized profit will change with each price change, so it can be reduced to zero or become an unrealized loss at any time. Unrealized profit becomes realized profit at the moment that a trade is exited.

## Recovery Factor

The recovery factor indicates how quickly a system recovers from a drawdown. The higher the value the better. At least we are looking for a value from 2.0+.
$$
RecoveryFactor=NetProfit \div MaxDrawdownInCurrency
$$

## Profit Factor

The profit factor should be at least 1.6.



## System Optimization

Look for results with numbers at least:

- Profit Factor > 1.6
- Drawdown < 15%
- Recovery Factor > 2

Expected Payoff means Profit per Trade.
