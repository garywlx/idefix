It is important to note that new bricks are only added when price movements completely "fill" the predetermined "brick size". Prices may exceed the values of the previous brick (either above or below), however a new brick will not be formed until the price movement is large enough. For example, let's say the brick size is set to 2 points and the last brick covers prices of $52 to $54. The new brick wonâ€™t be formed until prices close either at or above $56 or at or below $50. If price closes above $56, for example $57; the new brick must still stop at $56.

**There are two rules regarding brick placement:**

- Bricks will always have their corners touching.
- There can never be more than one brick in any one vertical column
